That same night, we were completely shocked and devastated to learn that she had a form of pediatric cancer called neuroblastoma and had to be airlifted to a children's hospital immediately. She was admitted to Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, MI and my husband and I dropped everything to be with her.<br /><br /> That first hospital stay lasted for almost three weeks before getting discharged, and even then we weren't sure if we should spend too much time so far away from the hospital while she was getting treatment. We have spent more time in Grand Rapids in the last nine months than we have at our own home and traveled from Marquette to GR at least once every 1-2 weeks since last September. That's a seven hour drive one way with a toddler! We don't have access to certain things she needs for her treatment in Marquette, so sometimes even simple blood draws require us to be at the children's hospital and keep us away from home for a longer period of time.<br /><br />We also just had to spend over three weeks in NY for her surgery and we were so appreciative of the financial support that UP Lions Serve was able to provide for us during that time. UP Lions Serve has helped lighten the financial burden that we have experienced having to travel over 400+ miles each time just to get her the treatment she needs to fight this disease. Knowing we can count on them to help us if we are in need of gas money or help with groceries and other travel expenses is a huge relief, especially because our daughter's treatment requires so much travel. We are so grateful to have their support on this very difficult journey."}],t=0,a=null;const l=()=>{t==0?s(4,t=r.length-1):s(4,t--,t),s(0,a="previous"),setTimeout(()=>s(0,a=null),200)},g=()=>{t==r.length-1?s(4,t=0):s(4,t++,t),s(0,a="next"),setTimeout(()=>s(0,a=null),200)};return i.$$.update=()=>{i.$$.dirty&16&&s(1,o=r[t])},[a,o,l,g,t]}class ve extends oe{constructor(e){super(),le(this,e,fe,me,Y,{})}}export{ve as default};
