                   Engadine High School Key Club raised $100 for Upper Peninsula children battling cancer. In the week leading up to Valentine’s Day, club members sold roses, carnations, and chocolate to their classmates, then delivered them on Friday, February 12.  All money raised was donated to the Lions Club Childhood Cancer project.<br /><br />Trinity Sapp of Curtis, a senior, and Sophie Gustafson of Naubinway, a junior, organized the Key Club’s efforts.  Ms. Sapp became familiar with the childhood cancer project when she volunteered time her time to catalog books donated to children involved in the project. She explains that she got involved in this project because she wanted to help other kids and do something good in these tough times.<br /><br />Christine Smith of Engadine, the chair of District 10 Lions Childhood Cancer Program, is delighted with the students’ efforts.  “Getting young people involved in the Lions’ community service programs helps not only the kids with cancer, but helps volunteers develop leadership skills and understand the value of serving their communities. We hope that this becomes a lifelong habit.”<br /><br />The Childhood Cancer project covers all of Lions’ District 10, which includes clubs across Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.  The program provides money for travel, food, medical, and other needed services to UP families with children battling cancer.  The program has partnered with other organizations that focus help for differing needs of childhood cancer patients.  With Maggie’s Wigs for Kids, children who have lost their hair can receive free wigs. With Kids Kicking Cancer, children and their siblings receive free virtual martial arts training geared toward their individual needs.  And with Camp Quality, the program is preparing for a future regional family camp at BayCliff Health Camp and is surveying families to determine interest.<br /><br />Smith explains that the Childhood Cancer Program has worked to identify families in need.  Since the program began, it has reached out to find those who want and need help. To date, 20 families are benefitting from the initiatives. She says that she is continuing to reach out to schools, health care providers, and anyone who can help families connect with the UP Childhood Cancer Initiative.<br /><br />Smith says that Upper Peninsula families coping with childhood cancer face tough challenges.  There are no pediatric cancer facilities in the Upper Peninsula, so patients receive treatment downstate, in Wisconsin, or in even more distant facilities. This may require families to travel long distances, or even to split families and live separately temporarily.<br /><br />The childhood cancer initiative has received generous financial support from the Graymont Community Development Fund. The program has also raised funds through a can drive and individual donations.

                   The District 10 Lions cancer program has helped 7 children and families battling childhood cancer from the Upper Peninsula. With the proceeds earned from the Marquette Club Cans for Kids with Cancer can and bottle drive, various club fundraisers, and club donations to the program, we have dispersed $3000 to help families with travel, food, and bills. All these families have sent a heartfelt "Thank You" to the District 10 Lions.<br /><br />To date, the Cans for Kids fundraiser has raised more funds than any of our fundraisers.
