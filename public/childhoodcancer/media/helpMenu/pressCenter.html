               <p class="hmBody">Camp Quality Michigan, with the support of the U.P. Lions Club, will be providing a Virtual Camp experience this year for U.P. and Wisconsin children that are currently in treatment or have previously been treated for cancer or have other chronic blood disorders, as well as their siblings. Camp week is July 12-16th. The camp theme this year is THRIVE. We will be taking kids on an adventure with daily themes of Creativity, Humor, Confidence, Gratitude, and Zest through the use of imagination, fun, and lots of enthusiasm.  Each child will receive a backpack filled with the items needed to participate in the week of camp along with other fun Camp Quality items. We will be using the ZOOM and FlipGrid platforms to interact with the kids throughout the week. We would traditionally hold a week long onsite camp, but due to COVID, will be providing a safer option for our families.<br /><br />We will also have an in-person kickoff event on June 19th at Bay Cliff Health Camp (following all State and National COVID guidelines). This will give the campers, siblings, and families an opportunity to meet Camp Quality staff, meet other campers, and see the beautiful camp facility where we plan to hold future family events and week-long camp.<br /><br />Camp Quality is a national organization with approximately 21 camps throughout the United States.  Camp Quality Michigan was the second camp started, with our first camp held in Boyne City Michigan in 1987.  We provide week long camping experiences for children diagnosed with cancer or blood disorders and their siblings along with several family events throughout the year.  All of our programs are offered to the families at no cost. Camp Quality is totally funded by fundraising events and generous donors such as the U.P. Lions.<br /><br />To register for the Virtual Camp and the Kickoff event, go to the Camp Quality Michigan website at: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.campqualityusa.org/mi/" class="bold1 colorb">https://www.campqualityusa.org/mi/</a> and click on the THRIVE logo on the home page.<br /><br />Please contact our Michigan Office at 231-582-2471 or Jean McDonough, Camp Quality Executive Director, at jean.mcdonough@campqualityusa.org or 231-675-5437 to learn more about our Virtual camp or any of our Camp Quality programs. We look forward to meeting all the wonderful U.P. and Wisconsin families!

                    Cut your hair and help kids with cancer.  Jennifer Lancour, owner of Northern Highlights Salon in Naubinway, is looking for a volunteer to be her first customer to donate tresses to a child who has lost hair due to cancer treatments or any other medical conditions leading to hair loss.  Her salon has registered with Maggie’s Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan and the hair cut at her salon will be donated to make a free wig for a Michigan child. The Upper Peninsula Lions Childhood Cancer Program will pay for hairstyling for the first donor.<br /><br />Lancour says that she’s happy to give back to her community and she is eager to find someone who has hair that is at least 10 inches long, has not been color treated within two years, and has no more than 10% gray.  Anyone interested can schedule an appointment, or have questions answered, by contacting Lancour at 906-477-6201.  The first haircut and style will be free, thanks to Lancour and the UP Lions.<br /><br />Maggie’s Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan will accept the donated hair and restore it into a customized wig, which will be given to a child who has lost his or her hair due to a medical condition or treatment. Maggie’s Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan is a nonprofit organization that provides wigs and support services to help the self esteem of Michigan children <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wigs4kids.org" class="bold1 colorb">https://www.wigs4kids.org/</a>.  All services are free and include wigs, skin restoration, nutrition, and medical support services. Maggie's helps all eligible kids in Michigan, charges nothing, and turns no one away.  Currently 17 salons in the UP are registered with Maggie’s Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan.  A list of registered salons is at Maggie’s website. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wigs4kids.org" class="bold1 colorb">https://www.wigs4kids.org/</a>.  Maggie’s requests 10” minimum hair length, although they will accept as short as 7 inches to make a boy's wig or a short wig for a girl (from top of ponytail to end).<br /><br />While Lancour is waiting for her first Maggie’s client, other salons have already cut hair for Maggie’s wigs.  Donating hair is easy, says Clare Feneley of Marquette, a graduate student pursuing her MBA at Northern Michigan University.  Feneley should know—she has donated her hair five times, starting when she was only 5 years old.  She says donating her hair has become a personal tradition—and besides, she says, “There’s nothing I’d use it for.”  She says that she has liked working with Maggie’s because they give the wigs to children at no cost to them, while some other wig makers charge patients for wigs made with donated hair.<br /><br />Christine Smith of Engadine, the chair of District 10 Lions Childhood Cancer Program, says that kids need to feel like kids and fit in with their peers.  District 10 includes Lions Clubs across Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. As so many parts of their lives are disrupted during cancer treatment, a child who receives a wig can enjoy some feeling of normalcy and acceptance, says Smith.<br /><br />Smith explains that Upper Peninsula families coping with childhood cancer face tough challenges.  There is no pediatric cancer facility in the Upper Peninsula, so patients receive treatment downstate, in Wisconsin, or in even more distant locations. This may require families to travel long distances, or even to split families and live separately temporarily.  Lions Clubs in the UP are helping.  The Childhood Cancer Initiative provides money for travel, food, medical, and other needed services to UP families with children battling cancer.<br /><br />Smith explains that the Childhood Cancer Program has worked to identify families in need.  Since the program began, it has reached out to find those who want and need help. To date, 24 families are benefiting from our help and resources.<br /><br />The childhood cancer initiative has received generous financial support from the Graymont Community Development Fund. The program has also raised funds through a can drive and individual donations, and the I Trekked the U.P fundraiser.

                    Get fit and help kids with cancer.  As part of the Childhood Cancer Initiative, the Upper Peninsula Lions Clubs are inviting everyone interested to join them tracking mileage for their fundraiser, I Trekked the UP.  This effort challenges participants to achieve their personal best through walking, running, snowshoeing, skiing, or biking, and donating pledges or a one-time donation to benefit kids with cancer and their families.<br /><br />Participating in this virtual event is easy.  At uplionsserve.org, anyone can register and select their donation amount.  Each donor of $25.00 or more receives a Childhood Cancer mask and bandana.  Donors can also download a Trek and Track sheet that allows them to log activities, times, or distances, as well as donations.<br /><br />The Trek event is beginning now and will continue through the end of March 2021. Additional challenges may be developed in the future.<br /><br />The event was created by Christine Smith of Engadine, the chair of District 10 Lions Childhood Cancer Program. District 10 includes Lions Clubs across Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.  The program provides money for travel, food, medical, and other needed services to UP families with children battling cancer.  The program has partnered with other organizations that focus help for differing needs of childhood cancer patients.  With Maggie’s Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan, children who have lost their hair can receive free wigs. Currently 16 salons in the UP are registered with Maggie’s and have trained cosmetologists to cut hair for creating wigs.  With Kids Kicking Cancer, children and their siblings receive free virtual martial arts training geared toward their individual needs.  In addition to martial arts classes, this training also includes meditation and breathing techniques that help children focus and gain strength and endurance. And with Camp Quality, the Lions program is preparing for a family camp at Bay Cliff Health Camp later in 2021.  This camp will be exclusively for children with childhood cancer and their families.<br /><br />Smith explains that the Childhood Cancer Program has worked to identify families in need.  Since the program began, it has reached out to find those who want and need help. To date, 19 families are benefitting from the initiatives. She says that she is continuing to reach out to schools, health care providers, and anyone who can help families connect with the U.P. Childhood Cancer Initiative.<br /><br />Smith says that Upper Peninsula families coping with childhood cancer face tough challenges.  There are no pediatric cancer facilities in the Upper Peninsula, so patients receive treatment downstate, in Wisconsin, or in even more distant facilities. This may require families to travel long distances, or even to split families and live separately temporarily.<br /><br />Jean McDonough of Charlevoix, the executive director of Camp Quality Michigan, is a family nurse practitioner who has worked with childhood cancer for more than 30 years.  She says that cancer treatment for children can be lengthy. Typical treatment for leukemia, the most common childhood cancer, is three years and the effects last even longer.  She says that 80% of pediatric cancer survivors experience life-long physical, cognitive, and growth and development issues.<br /><br />The childhood cancer initiative has received generous financial support from the Graymont Community Development Fund. The program has also raised funds through a can drive and individual donations.

                    UP children with cancer, their siblings, and other children confronting serious illness can now take free martial arts classes to empower themselves.  Lions across the UP are partnering with Kids Kicking Cancer to bring daily online classes to children across the UP. Kids Kicking Cancer offers virtual classes that explore breath, meditation, and traditional martial arts as tools to empower children who face serious illness.<br /><br />September is recognized by many organizations around the world as Childhood Cancer Awareness month, so UP Lions are spreading the news about help that is available.<br /><br />Kids Kicking Cancer was created in Michigan in 1999 by Rabbi Elimelech Goldberg, a black belt rabbi and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics. He lost his first child to leukemia at the age of two and brings a wealth of personal experience and sensitivity to dealing with children and families facing life-threatening illness.  This program now teaches over 7,000 children in 90 hospitals and program locations in seven countries.<br /><br />Kids Kicking Cancer also has a black-belt program for patients who are not responding to treatments. This end-of-life care program provides ongoing meditation and family focus in a palliative format that culminates in the child receiving a black-belt, usually a few days before he or she dies. Embroidered on the black-belt are the words “Master Teacher” because that child is truly teaching the world how to use the power of light to break through darkness.<br /><br />One of the alumni of the first Kids Kicking Cancer programs is Michael Hunt, who now is a martial arts therapist with the program.  A 20+ year pediatric cancer survivor, he holds a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do.  Michael has worked with Kids Kicking Cancer since 2005, teaching classes and working with hospitalized children.  Sensei Michael says that one of the most helpful aspects of the program is its focus on empowerment.  In the program, each child becomes a teacher to others. When asked what is your purpose? the children yell out, “To teach the world.”<br /><br />Naami Kosofsky is Kids Kicking Cancer’s Social Worker.  She coordinates free family support services, guiding parents to financial and social resources outside the program.  She also develops additional programming, including social activities for families.  Kosofky says the pandemic has changed how Kids Kicking Cancer provides services, making the outreach into the UP easier.  Before the pandemic, classes were live and locations varied each day. Now, online classes are available each day wherever a child and his siblings are.  Children in the program can attend as many days, for as long as they wish—even after the cancer treatments have stopped.   Families interested in finding out more or enrolling in the program may contact Cindy Cohen at Kids Kicking Cancer, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:cindy@kidskickingcancer.org" class="bold1 colorb">cindy@kidskickingcancer.org</a>.<br /><br />Children who participate also receive a uniform and a backpack with surprise gifts.  UP Lions are reimbursing Kids Kicking Cancer for the cost of uniforms and backpacks, through a generous grant from the Graymont Community and Economic Development Fund and local fundraising efforts throughout the UP.  Lions also assist families with cancer in several other ways, including financial assistance, free wigs offered Maggie’s Wigs for Kids, and Camp Quality.

                    Some cancers are only seen in children.  Awareness, education and support are vital, which is why Childhood Cancer Awareness month is also vital!  Childhood cancer is devastating to the growth and development in children and also devastating to their family and friends.  When kids should be focused on school, play, and socializing, they are focused on medications, operations and procedures.(Quote from Deb Griffin-Nurse Practitioner).<br /><br />The Lions clubs of the UP can help those affected by childhood cancer to “Survive and Thrive”.  The UP Lions childhood cancer program has helped 4 families thus far, including 3 year old Preslie (in the photo), with funds for travel, food and medical expenses.  Preslie is continuing to undergo treatment at Children’s Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  In addition, there are 3 non profit organizations that offer services to kids with cancer and their siblings in the UP.<br /><br />Maggie’s Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan provides wigs and support services to help the self esteem of Michigan children, as they journey through their health challenges, empowering them to look and feel better.  No child is turned away and all services are at no cost.<br /><a target="_blank" href="mailto:maggie@wigs4kids.org" class="bold1 colorb">maggie@wigs4kids.org</a><br /><br />Kids Kicking Cancer provides therapeutic martial arts classes to empower sick children to heal physically, spiritually and emotionally.

                    Upper Peninsula Lions are reaching out to help families with children who are battling cancer. Two fundraisers have raised more than $15,500—all of which will go directly to assist families.<br /><br />Graymont Community and Economic Development Fund announced on Tuesday, July 28, that it is awarding a grant of $7500 to the District 10 Lions Pediatric Cancer Program. And in a separate initiative, three Lions clubs raised $8,172 through the efforts of the Marquette, Gwinn, and Engadine-Newberry Lions clubs that collected, counted, and sorted over 80,000 returnable cans.<br /><br />Christine A. Smith of Engadine, the District 10 Lions Pediatric Cancer Chairman, says she is delighted with these results. Smith says the Lions have identified 10 families across the UP who have children with cancer. She explains that treatment is particularly challenging since there are no pediatric cancer treatment facilities in the UP. Instead, families must plan for sometimes lengthy stays where care is available. She encourages anyone who is a UP resident and has a child with cancer to contact her. With these additional funds, Lions are able to expand their efforts.<br /><br />Rylan, an Upper Peninsula 4-year-old who is being treated for high-risk neuroblastoma, is one of the children the Lions have helped. His father is very grateful for assistance asRylan receives treatment at University of Michigan hospitals in Ann Arbor, including surgery, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, and more. This treatment requires lengthy hospitalizations, keeping Rylan and his mom away from his father and siblings for months.<br /><br />Smith explained four ways the newly raised funds will be used. First, donations help meet some of the many costs that insurance does not cover. Second, through a partnership with Bay Cliff Health Facility, Lions will cover expenses for families to participate in a fun family weekend at Camp Quality, May 7 – 9, 2021. Planning for the camp is flexible and will adjust to the changing demands presented by COVID 19. Lions funds will also help provide free wigs for children who have lost hair through chemotherapy. Through a partnership with Maggie’s Wigs4Kids, Lions from across the Upper Peninsula will be reaching out in September, during Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month, to encourage donations of hair to make these wigs.<br /><br />And Lions have partnered with Kids Kicking Cancer, a global organization dedicated to lowering the pain of children by teaching them martial arts as a therapy. Children learn breath work, meditation, and traditional karate. Lions are helping to stock backpacks for participants with books for children ages 2-18, and $5 gift certificates from Target, Meijer and Walmart.
