                    The partnership with Camp Quality and Bay Cliff Health Camp continues and we have rescheduled a camp for kids with cancer for September of 2021. It will be the first of its kind in the Upper Peninsula.<br /><br />Camp Quality is a nonprofit organization that has been serving children with cancer and their families for over 30 years by providing year-round programs, experiences, and companionship, at no cost to the family.<br /><br />When a child is diagnosed with cancer, in a lot of ways, childhood stops. Vacations, family time, crafts, and campfires are replaced with doctor visits, chemo, isolation, and restrictions. With children's safety and medical needs at the forefront, Camp Quality breaks down those barriers for children and families and restores the childhood experience. Surrounded by new friends that can relate, enthusiastic volunteers who care, and loads of fun experiences, Camp Quality campers find joy, courage, and renewed hope for the future. They are free to be themselves… free to be kids again.<br /><br /><span class="bold1">CAMP QUALITY GOALS:</span><br />Provide fun, exciting, confidence-building activities while meeting new friends and building existing friendships with those who face similar circumstances.<br /><br />Promote hope and inspiration while helping children foster life skills and develop their full potential.<br /><br />Offer psychological support to assist in manages stress.<br /><br />Give every child and family affected by childhood cancer a broad community of support.<br /><br />Camp Quality serves more than 170 campers and siblings in Michigan during our signature week-long residential camps. We strive to provide the safest, most enjoyable environment for our campers, away from the everyday stresses of their diagnosis. We provide 24-hour, on-site medical care to make sure campers are taken care of while still being afforded the opportunity to just be kids. Each of our locations offers a fun-filled week.<br /><br /><span class="bold1">CURRENT CAMP QUALITY LOCATIONS:</span><br />North Camp - Luther, Michigan<br /><br />South Comp - Fenton, Michigan<br /><br />Teen Camp - Beaver Island, Michigan<br /><br />Sibling Camp - Lapeer, Michigan<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://campqualityusa.org/mi/" class="bold1">https://www.campqualityusa.org/mi/</a>

                    Lions across the UP are partnering with Kids Kicking Cancer to bring daily online classes to children across the UP. Kids Kicking Cancer offers virtual classes that explore breath, meditation, and traditional martial arts as tools to empower children who face serious illness.<br /><br />Kids Kicking Cancer was created in Michigan in 1999 by Rabbi Elimelech Goldberg, a black belt rabbi and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics. He lost his first child to leukemia at the age of two and brings a wealth of personal experience and sensitivity to dealing with children and families facing life-threatening illness. This program now teaches over 7,000 children in 90 hospitals and program locations in seven countries.<br /><br />Kids Kicking Cancer also has a black-belt program for patients who are not responding to treatments. This end-of-life care program provides ongoing meditation and family focus in a palliative format that culminates in the child receiving a black-belt, usually a few days before he or she dies. Embroidered on the black-belt are the words “Master Teacher” because that child is truly teaching the world how to use the power of light to break through darkness.<br /><br />One of the alumni of the first Kids Kicking Cancer programs is Michael Hunt (shown above), who now is a martial arts therapist with the program. A 20+ year pediatric cancer survivor, he holds a 2nd-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. Michael has worked with Kids Kicking Cancer since 2005, teaching classes and working with hospitalized children. Sensei Michael says that one of the most helpful aspects of the program is its focus on empowerment. In the program, each child becomes a teacher to others. When asked what is your purpose? the children yell out, “To teach the world.”<br /><br />Naami Kosofsky is Kids Kicking Cancer’s Social Worker. She coordinates free family support services, guiding parents to financial and social resources outside the program. She also develops additional programming, including social activities for families. Kosofky says the pandemic has changed how Kids Kicking Cancer provides services, making the outreach into the UP easier. Before the pandemic, classes were live and locations varied each day. Now, online classes are available each day wherever a child and his siblings are. Children in the program can attend as many days, for as long as they wish—even after the cancer treatments have stopped.<br /><br />Children who participate also receive a uniform and a backpack with surprise gifts. UP Lions are reimbursing Kids Kicking Cancer for the cost of uniforms and backpacks, through a generous grant from the Graymont Community and Economic Development Fund and local fundraising efforts throughout the UP.<br /><br /><a class="bold1" target="_blank" href="https://kidskickingcancer.org/">https://www.kidskickingcancer.org/</a>

                    Thank you, Lila and Arabella! These four-year-old twins (shown above) from Escanaba were inspired to donate their hair to Maggie's Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan after their aunt and cousin donated their hair at Tangles salon in Escanaba. Tangles is the first salon in the Upper Peninsula that became registered as a Maggie's Wigs 4 Kids salon by the Bay de Noc Lions Club. This is a true example of "Kids Helping Kids".<br /><br />Please visit Maggie's Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan for specifics about salon registration and hair donation.<br /><br />As Magie Varney (founder and CEO of Maggie's Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan) says, "It's not just about the hair. It's about the self-esteem. You can never have enough hair."September is Childhood Cancer Awareness month. The Upper Peninsula Lions started a campaign to register salons in the Upper Peninsula as Maggie's Wigs 4 Kids of Michigan salons. We are encouraging all hairstylists and salons in the UP to register. The "Hair Raiser" kicked off in September and is ongoing.<br /><br /><a class="bold1" target="_blank" href="https://wigs4kids.org/">https://www.wigs4kids.org/</a>

                    Northwoods Airlifeline is a non-profit organization of volunteer pilots from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northeast Wisconsin who donate their time and aircraft to help patients and their families with urgent medical needs for services not found locally. Since our founding in 1989, over 2000 missions have been flown to destinations in lower Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Connecticut, and Texas, all at no cost to the individual.<br /><br />Northwoods Airlifeline helps meet the needs of individuals who are financially distressed, unable to travel by other means, or under severe time constraints. We have found the most urgent transports involve transplant cases, since there is no place in the Upper Peninsula where transplants are done and the window of opportunity to perform the procedure is small. We frequently receive transport requests from chronically ill people who cannot drive long distances or afford commercial flights to specialized medical facilities. We also transport individuals beyond medical help who want only to be taken home be with their families, a service not covered by insurance. Relatives of severely injured patients transferred out of area may themselves need immediate transportation to be with their loved ones. These are among the many logistical gaps in medical care that Northwoods Airlifeline attempts to fill.<br /><br />Northwoods Airlifeline was conceived by Bob Larson of Kingsford, Michigan in 1989. Northwoods Airlifeline, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, is governed by a board of nine pilots and community leaders. We solicit referrals from a wide network of community professionals and institutions. Our activities have been warmly received by specialized hospital care units such as the CS Mott Children’s Hospital and University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Northwoods Airlifeline is also affiliated with the St Vincent De Paul Society, the Salvation Army, and the Shriners through their excellent system of hospitals. Northwoods Airlifeline is associated with Air Care Alliance in Manassas, Virginia. The Lions Clubs of Michigan has been a major supporter of our efforts, particularly in the construction of our hangar at the Iron Mountain airport in 1999.<br /><br />Northwoods Airlifeline (NWALL) welcomes your support. Founder Bob Larson puts it very well: “Before we formed NWALL, I didn’t realize how many people in the U.P. are suffering from cancer and other serious medical problems, or who are anxiously waiting for an organ transplant. My phone rings at all hours, but the rewards are great.” We echo the words of our founder as we carry on the mission he began.<br /><br />The Upper Peninsula of Michigan covers over 60.000 square miles with a population of about 350,000. Located between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, inclement weather, such as heavy snowfall or icing in the clouds and near the ground, is common. Since 1989 Northwoods Airlifeline has completed over 2000 missions, with only about 100 postponed due to inclement weather.<br /><br />If you need assistance, please call <a class="bold1" href="tel:18885280131">1 (888) 528-0131</a>.<br /><br /><a class="bold1" target="_blank" href="https://northwoodsairlifeline.org">https://www.northwoodsairlifeline.org</a>
